# Whiteboard

An attempt to make a beautiful whiteboard.
The app is incomplete, a lot of things do not work so far.

List of things that does work:
1) Pointer tool - to select and modify size, move, rotate objects, etc.
2) Pencil tool - to draw with options to select one of the three available sizes, and one of the eight provided colors.
3) Eraser tool - to remove complete objects from the canvas. Keep pressing left mouse button and move mouse over objects and they will be long gone.
4) Zooming and panning (To zoom, press Ctrl + mouse wheel, to pan, press SPACEBAR and drag mouse while pressing left mouse button).
5) Right click menu, everything except the properties option.

What doesnot work:
1) Basically, everything other than the ones mentioned above :)

Will appreciate any ideas, suggestions, improvements, etc.
Made by using fabric.js library :)

Also, I created my own stupid templating language XD, the templating engine is the file: template.py, and it modifies the source file: main.html, to produce the final file: index.html. Basically, it just replaces the comments of format <!- TEMPLATE {FILE-LOCATION} --> with the file in the location :)

Have a nice day :)
